# PlantPal: A Watering Reminder App

::Gif Demo coming soon...::

## An App for Thirsty Plants Everywhere

PlantPal is an app that reminds users when to water their plants. Users can save their plants to the database, log how often their plants need to be watered, and be informed when itâ€™s time. Marking plants as watered resets the time so users can do it all over again.

## Why I Built This

I can't tell you exactly how many houseplants I've killed, but it's a lot. Most. All? Basically, I've overwatered many a succulent and underwatered many a flower. That's also a story I've consistently heard from other people. I love having plants in the house and decided that our plants deserve better. That's when Plant Pal was born.
